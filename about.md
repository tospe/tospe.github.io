Hi ü§üüèΩ I'm Tomas, and Electrical Engineer Graduated, Full stack, Machine Learning Engineer, and sports enthusiast. I am [tospe](https://github.com/tospe) at github, [tomassp](https://gitlab.com/tomassp) at gitlab and [tospe.ami@gmail.com](mailto:tospe.ami@gmail.com). [My Resume.](/cv_tsp.pdf)


Currently i am working as a Machine Learning at Fraunhofer where I do machine learning research applied to industry. I developed Machine Learning / Deep Learning solutions in predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, nlp. I also lead the internal Mlops group that tries to improve the ML solutions end-to-end from good code structure to experiment tracking and data versioning. Since I believe education is very important I also gave some machine learning courses to different companies in Portugal.  

From mid 2020 to mid 2021 I have been working as a freelancer. I have developed websites ([1](http://advogadosporto.com/)) and machine learning products (sports team video classification). 

After returning from Hong Kong, I started working in my master thesis with the title of u-cf2vec: Representation Learning for Personalized Algorithm Selection in Recommender Systems. Developed the framework in python using Meta learning, Representation Learning and Collaborative Filtering. The code was runned in google colab and google compute engine. This [work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346551) was published in ICDM 2020. I Graduated in late 2020.

During the first semester of last year (2019), I was an exchange student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In 2017 I went to London to work at Eat First a food delivery company as a Operations Intern.

While attending university, I worked at Junta Digital small web developer startup in Porto from 2015 until 2019. I developed websites in laravel (octobercms), HTML5, CSS. Examples: [latitid](http://latitid.com/), [casa ciencias](https://www.casadasciencias.org/), [parity](https://goparity.com/)

In late 2015 i started the my Integrated Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Porto

During the last two years of the highschool I was a research student at IBMC with the goal to study the mielin cell in rats.


Born in 1997. Playing rugby since 2007.
